No-one really knows why the light went out

but no one will ever forget that day

that is...no one but me

Its as if someone erased my memories 



Most people adapted

Some coudn't handle it

Me?

I didn't stop

I kept searching 

Searching for answers


I don't remember life before that day, but I know it had to be better than...than this

Apparently light served as some sort of energy source, and now that is was gone, most everything that relied on it simply died.

Then they came...

Those that survived the blackout, lived the rest of their lives in fear

I wasn't afraid...for I had found light

If anyone is hearing this, this is not the end
